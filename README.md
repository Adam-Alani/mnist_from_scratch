# mnist_from_scratch
## Weekend (WIP) project to learn about machine learning theory

Basic backpropagation neural network with several features such as
 - ReLu, Sigmoid, and Softmax
 - Mean Squared Error and Cross Entropy Loss functions
 - Convolution layer (that still needs optimization as of writing this)


Other:
 - XOR Solver with Sigmoid + Softmax
 - MNIST implementation in PyTorch aswell
